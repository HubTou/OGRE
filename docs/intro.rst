Introduction
============

At the beginning...
-------------------
It all started when my youngest son picked up introductory computer science
courses at high school. When the Covid-19 crisis and social distancing response
started, I decided to give him some additional help with algorithmics and Python
programming. As a learning exercise, we started a small project to implement a
`Connect Four`_ game in Python. The initial version was a text-based player against
player implementation. From here, we used Pygame_ to go for a graphics version,
and then a player vs computer version using Minimax_ algorithm... (we'll publish
it one day, once we tidy up the source code)

Getting interested in Python and Pygame, I began to write other games to follow
up on this promising path. With `John Horton Conway`_'s untimely passing, I wrote a
little `game of life`_ implementation.

The next step was to write a multi-player game...
