# OGRE
Open Games Room for Everyone, is a free players lounge/lobby system that devs can use for their Multi Players games.

Unlike my other repositories, this project is not complete (just starting in fact) and really open to other contributors. At this stage, I started some Read the Docs design documentation at https://readthedocs.org/projects/open-game-rooms-for-everyone/

I need it for multi players games that I'm currently writing or planning to do with PyGame.
