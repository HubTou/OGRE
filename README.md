# OGRE
Open Games Room for Everyone, is a free players lounge/lobby system that devs can use for their Multi Players games.

Unlike my other repositories, this one is not complete (just starting in fact) and really open to outside contributors.
I need it for multi players games that I'm currently starting to write with PyGame.
